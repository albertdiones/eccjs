=====

nodey ecc lib based on [SJCL](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/)'s [ECC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography) Implementation `v0.3.0` (Beta)

## Example

``` js
var crypto = require('crypto')
var ecc = require('eccjs')

// Generate (or load) encryption/decryption keys 
var curve = ecc.curves.k256
var keys = ecc.generate(curve);
// => { public: <Buffer...>, private: <Buffer ...>}

// sign a message
var plaintext = "hello world!";
//the hash, as a buffer
var hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(plaintext, 'utf8').digest()

var sig = ecc.sign(curve, keys.private, hash)
var valid = ecc.verify(curve, keys.public, hash, sig)
console.log(valid)
// => true 
```

## API

* `ecc.generate(type[, curve = 192])`
* `ecc.sign(curve, key, hash)`
* `ecc.verify(curve, key, signature, hash)`
* `ecc.kem(curve, key, paranoia)`
* `ecc.unkem(curve, key)`
